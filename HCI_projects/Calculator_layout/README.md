# Calculator

This study aims to analyze user performance by calculating the Index of Difficulty (ID) and Movement Time (MT) metrics.
+ The interface displays arithmetic terms in the format 'a.bc * d.ef', where each placeholder (a-f) represents a digit between 0 and 9.
+ Users are required to press the according numbers to compute the given term, followed by a '=' to output the solution to the screen. 
+ After 5 seconds the displays output gets cleared, and a new term appears.
+ After 20 multiplications, the system generates a '.txt' file containing the ID and MT values for further analysis
